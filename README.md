# Dotfiles

## About

This repository contains most of the dotfiles I use on my current system. It is mainly
meant as a backup for myself and a convenient way to access it. You are however free to
take whatever you want from them, but good chunks of them are fragments of dotfiles from
other people or the documentation I modified to suit my needs.
